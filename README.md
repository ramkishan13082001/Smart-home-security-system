🏠 Smart Home Security System using PIC18F4580

An advanced Embedded Systems capstone project integrating 8 hardware peripherals into a complete industrial-style smart security and access control system using the PIC18F4580 Microcontroller.

📌 Project Overview

This project demonstrates the design and implementation of a Smart Home Security System capable of:

Secure password-based door access
Real-time intrusion detection using interrupts
UART event logging to PC
Automatic porch lighting using an LDR sensor
Hardware PWM-based door motor control
LCD-based user interaction
Multitasking embedded firmware architecture

The project simulates a real commercial security product used in:

Smart Homes
Biometric Door Locks
Smart Buildings
Industrial Access Systems
IoT-based Monitoring Systems
🚀 Major Features
🔐 Password-Based Access Control
Uses a 4x3 matrix keypad
Accepts a secure 4-digit password
Masks password entry using *
Controls door lock motor after authentication
🚨 Intrusion Detection System
Uses INT0 external hardware interrupt
Simulated using a push button (PIR trigger)
Instantly interrupts all running tasks
Triggers:

                                   🚨 Interrupt-Based Emergency Handling

The intrusion detection system uses:
void __interrupt() ISR()
This ensures:

Immediate response
Highest priority execution
Instant alarm activation
Door forced into locked state

Unlike polling systems, interrupts allow:

Real-time emergency response
Fast hardware reaction
Industrial-grade security handling
🌙 ADC-Based Smart Lighting

The LDR is connected to:

RA0 / AN0

ADC continuously reads ambient light levels:

if (light_level < 300)
    PORTCbits.RC4 = 1;
else
    PORTCbits.RC4 = 0;

This enables:

Automatic porch lighting
Energy efficiency
Smart home behavior
⚙️ PWM Door Control

PWM is generated using:

CCP1 Module
Timer2

Door states:

PWM Duty	Door State
0	Locked
1023	Open
⏲️ Timer1 Auto-Lock Mechanism

After successful authentication:

Door opens
Timer1 waits for 5 seconds
Door automatically locks again

This simulates:

Automatic security relocking
Real-world smart lock systems
💻 UART Configuration

UART Baud Rate:

9600 bps

UART functions:

Event monitoring
Debugging
PC communication
IoT gateway foundation
🛡️ Security Features
Feature	Purpose
Password Masking	Prevent shoulder surfing
Auto Locking	Prevent unattended access
Interrupt Alarm	Immediate intrusion response
UART Logging	Security monitoring
Forced Locking	Emergency protection
